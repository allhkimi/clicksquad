## Submission: User Analysis

1. **Title: Gathering Requirements - User Analysis**

2. **Proposed Tasks**  
   - **Task 1: Automatic Wellness Tracking**  
   - **Task 2: Mental Health Support**  
   - **Task 3: Interactive Health Education**  

3. **Persona**  
   - **Persona 1: Harry – The Overwhelmed Student**  
     Harry is a second-year Computer Science student balancing a hectic schedule of classes, tutoring, and extracurriculars. His time constraints and constant academic pressure make it difficult for him to maintain healthy routines, even though he understands their importance. He often neglects basic health habits like hydration and sleep.  

     Harry is motivated to manage his stress and avoid burnout by adopting simple health routines. He struggles with staying organized and is discouraged by apps that require too much effort or present information in overwhelming ways. Harry needs a tool that fits seamlessly into his busy day and helps him build sustainable habits without extra mental load.  

   - **Persona 2: Jason Lim – The Burned-Out Young Professional**  
     Jason is a 26-year-old software developer working long hours at a fast-paced startup. His intense work schedule causes him to neglect his physical and mental well-being. He often skips meals and lacks the energy or motivation to engage in traditional wellness apps that require frequent interaction or notifications.  

     Jason is motivated to reduce stress, improve emotional regulation, and avoid the long-term health risks of a sedentary lifestyle. He prefers passive, low-effort tools that can integrate wellness support into his daily workflow without interrupting productivity. He values subtle, practical nudges that help him maintain balance without judgment.  

   - **Persona 3: Aisyah – The Confused Health Seeker**  
     Aisyah is a 19-year-old first-year Education student learning to live independently for the first time. She wants to be healthy but feels overwhelmed by conflicting health advice online. She finds most health apps too technical, clinical, or dull. Aisyah prefers learning through visual, interactive content and needs guidance in understanding what being "healthy" actually means.  

     She is motivated by the desire to build healthy habits like eating better and staying hydrated, but needs tools that feel approachable, friendly, and fun. Aisyah learns best at her own pace, especially through gamified, bite-sized content. She wants to be supported—not lectured—on her wellness journey.  

4. **Scenario**  
   - **Persona 1: Harry – The Overwhelmed Student**  
     - **Task 1: Automatic Wellness Tracking**  
       After several late nights working on coding assignments and tutoring, Harry realizes he has been skipping meals and barely drinking water. He feels sluggish but does not have the time or energy to manually log his habits. He needs a tool that can automatically track his wellness without adding to his cognitive load.  

     - **Task 2: Mental Health Support**  
       After a particularly overwhelming week filled with deadlines, club meetings, and social obligations, Harry feels emotionally exhausted and anxious. He turns to PulsePath for quick emotional check-ins and guided mindfulness exercises that do not take up too much of his time.  

     - **Task 3: Interactive Health Education**  
       Harry stumbles across a short, gamified quiz in the app titled “What’s Your Ideal Study Routine?” After completing it, he receives practical tips on managing stress and optimizing focus. The visuals and humor keep him engaged without feeling like a lecture.  

   - **Persona 2: Jason Lim – The Burned-Out Young Professional**  
     - **Task 1: Automatic Wellness Tracking**  
       Jason starts using PulsePath’s background tracking features to monitor his sleep and activity without any manual input. At the end of his workday, he receives a summary: “You’ve been sedentary for 6 hours today. How about a quick stretch?” These subtle nudges help him become more mindful of his health without disrupting his productivity.  

     - **Task 2: Mental Health Support**  
       After a 10-hour coding sprint, Jason feels drained. PulsePath checks in with a simple, “How are you today?” He taps “stressed” and is guided through a short breathing exercise. A calming message appears: “Small breaks matter.” It helps him pause, breathe, and reset without needing to schedule anything.  

     - **Task 3: Interactive Health Education**  
       Jason skips lunch—again. PulsePath nudges him with a 1-minute lesson titled “What skipping meals does to your focus.” A quick animation and takeaway tip appear. He learns something useful instantly and reconsiders his fast food habits for the day.  

   - **Persona 3: Aisyah – The Confused Health Seeker**  
     - **Task 1: Automatic Wellness Tracking**  
       Between classes, Aisyah checks PulsePath and sees a cheerful reminder: “You’ve had 3 glasses of water today—2 more to go!” Her step count, hydration, and sleep data are tracked automatically. There are no graphs or stats—just friendly encouragement that makes her smile and stay motivated.  

     - **Task 2: Mental Health Support**  
       Feeling lonely and overwhelmed after a stressful exam, Aisyah opens the app and selects “Feeling Anxious” from the SOS menu. A short animation helps her slow her breathing. The app gently explains how stress affects her body and reassures her that taking breaks is okay.  

     - **Task 3: Interactive Health Education**  
       Curious about sleep, Aisyah clicks on a quiz titled “Are You a Night Owl or Early Bird?” She laughs at the fun results and watches a short, colorful video on better bedtime habits. It feels like a casual learning experience—not a lecture—and she comes away with practical bedtime tips.

## Introduction

The application being tested in this project is called Headspace, a widely used mental wellness mobile app that offers guided meditations, mindfulness exercises, sleep aids, and focus-enhancing content. Headspace is designed to support users in managing stress, improving sleep, enhancing focus, and cultivating a daily mindfulness practice. The purpose of this assessment is to examine how users engage with the Headspace app’s current features and identify any opportunities for improvement, patterns, challenges, and usability issues they may encounter. This is achieved by performing Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) on user behavior as they attempt to complete the three essential tasks mentioned in user analysis. These tasks were selected based on their relevance to the core mental wellness activities and are representative of key features often included in similar applications, including Headspace itself.

### 2. Findings from the HTAs for Task 1

The HTA findings for Task 1 revealed key usability differences between Google Fit and Headspace when it comes to automatic wellness tracking. Three main criteria such as ease of navigation, clarity of feature discovery, efficiency of data access and feedback output are observed from these HTAs across different users. User 1 (Google Fit) demonstrated a streamlined and structured path with minimal confusion. Tasks like viewing steps, manually entering data, and syncing apps were logically organized and predictable, resulting in a clear output, for instance, activity records and health data. In contrast, User 2 (Headspace) encountered major challenges with discoverability and feedback, such as misclicking on a free trial prompt, struggling to differentiate between stress and anxiety features, and confusion caused by inconsistent UI feedback, such as toggles not working, unclear navigation flows; leading to delayed or unclear output. User 3 (Headspace) had a slightly smoother journey but still had to manually dig through menus to enable tracking and connect with external apps, suggesting low visibility and depth-buried features. These findings point toward the need for more intuitive navigation, better feedback clarity, consistent interface responses, and clearly labeled wellness features in Headspace to match the usability standard set by Google Fit.

### 4. Findings from the HTAs for Task 2

The HTAs show the different behaviors of users when using Headspace, highlighting different usage patterns based on the user’s intention with the app. User 1 follows a structured path to go through the app, while user 2 takes a more exploratory approach by exploring each section to find what they are looking for. For user 3, they use Headspace to track and manage stress levels.  

There are some common issues faced across these users, such as subscription-based contents and unclear labelling of features and roles, leading to confusion and repetition of navigation when trying to seek help from an already distressed user. This suggests that, even though Headspace is a feature-rich app, it still lacks discoverability and contextual guidance.  

To improve the user experience, the app should consider making some features, especially the essential ones like SOS and help content, more accessible. Additionally, improving the clarity of functions and sections, and adding more navigation guidance, like tooltips, will also increase the overall user experience.

### 6. Findings from the HTAs for Task 3

The HTA for Task3 revealed moderate usability with several areas for improvement. Navigation to the Explore section was intuitive, but users faced challenges in discovering specific mental health content. The search function required precise keywords, lacking suggestions, which make it harder to find relevant topics.  

Identifying unlocked vs. premium content was also unclear, often requiring users to tap into each item to check accessibility. This led to repeated trial-and-error and increased user frustration. Additionally, some content was perceived as too general, prompting users to loop through search and browse steps multiple times before finding helpful resources.  

There was limited feedback, with no bookmarking based on user behavior. These findings suggest a need for clearer content labeling, improved search tools, and better feedback or guidance features to support smoother and more engaging exploration.  

There was also a lack of personalization and feedback mechanisms. Users could not bookmark useful resources or track their progress through the educational material. Without personalized suggestions or visible history, it was difficult for users to resume their journey or build a consistent learning path.

## Design Requirements

Based on the findings, the following is our proposed design requirements, aim to enhance the user experience:  

1. **Improve Discoverability**  
   - Redesign so the essential features (e.g. SOS and meditate) are visible and easy to access without making user have to digged down to the app.  
   - Implement a search and filter function for quick access to specific features.  

2. **Enhance Navigation Clarity**  
   - Introduce guided walkthrough for first time users to go through the sections.  
   - Add tooltips across the app so users can get more information regarding the current section they are in.  
   - Provide more meaningful labels and explanation for the roles and sections.  

3. **Increase Access to Essential Features**  
   - Allow critical features to be accessible for users without requiring a subscription.  
   - Clearly differentiate between free and paid content.  
   - Offer brief previews of premium features to set user expectations.  

4. **Transparent Paywalls**  
   - Avoid sudden promotion of subscription in the middle of user interaction.  
   - Include a “skip for now” button without having to disrupt user progress.
