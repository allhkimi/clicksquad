### Justification of the Design

The design choices are justified by being in line with the three main goals of the project:

#### Goal 1: Automatic Wellness Tracking
-Tracking features are included to help users log and monitor their physical and mental wellness.

-The menu is designed to be easy to access from the Home Page to encourage users to stay consistent throughout their wellness journey.

-Daily progress tracking is integrated to facilitate the habits development and personalised wellness tracking.

#### Goal 2: Mental Health Support
-Features such as Meditate and SOS Support offer quick access to emotional help and calming exercises.

-The SOS menu provides instant assistance in emergencies, focussing on user-centered and safety-oriented design.

#### Goal 3: Interactive Health Education
-Education menu is used for users to learn more on topics like stress, wellness, and healthy habits.

-The educational features are simplified for simplicity for users and are accessible from the home page for a seamless learning flow.


#### Overall Design Justification:
-Centralized Navigation: The Home Page functions as a central point with easy access to all major features.

-User Flow Consistency: Navigation paths are clean and logically structured to reduce cognitive load.

-Accessibility: Design components consider both usability and the need for quick support for users.

-Engagement and Simplicity: Layouts and task flows are minimalistic and kept simple to ensure users are not overwhelmed.


### Description and Justification of Metaphors

#### Heart icon
Saved menu lets users save their favorite contents throughout the app, such as articles and videos, so they can easily and quickly return to them later. A heart is used as the icon because hearts are commonly used to represent something we love or care about. This makes it easy for users to understand that this menu stores their favorite items.


#### House icon
The Home menu brings users to the main screen of the app. From here, users can go to any other part of the app. The house icon is a simple and familiar symbol that represents the starting point of any app or website. Users can know and understand that this is where they can always come back to.


#### Rewinded Clock icon
The History menu shows users what they have done in the app before, like past quizzes. This can help users reflect on their progress. The icon is a combination of a clock and a back arrow because this shows that the menu is about looking back at what has already happened.


#### Dashboard metaphor
Across all menus throughout the app, the menus work like a dashboard (like in a car, for example), to help people see/view all the important things quickly. For instance, for task 1, in the Activity submenu, users can view key data like steps and distance record for the day at a glance. 


#### Check-up page as a clock
The pop-up asks users how they feel, like a quick emotional check-up. Itâ€™s quick and simple, like checking the time at the clock.


#### Journal metaphor
The Tracking menu and Meditate submenu in task 1 are similar to a health journal or a personal diary, where users can track their progress daily and write or reflect their feelings. This can help users to stay motivated and think calmly and clearly.


#### Emergency Alarm metaphor 
The SOS button in task 2 is made big and round to make it easier for users in need to spot it. It functions like a panic button that is familiar from something like alarms, so users can relate it with immediate help and urgency.


#### Library metaphor
In task 3, the Education menu represents a library that has various shelves and books for different kinds of topics. The submenus, like Video, Audio, Quiz, and Article are the shelves, while the contents (for example, the videos in the Video menu) are the books that the users can take and gain the information from.


#### School Test metaphor
The quizzes in task 3 are made to make the users feel like they are doing tests like back in school. Users can check what they have learned so far and can get a sense of achievement when completing it.
