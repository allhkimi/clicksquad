## 1. Introduction

In an era where mental health and well-being are becoming increasingly important, our group developed PulsePath, a holistic wellness mobile application designed to empower users in managing their mental and physical health. PulsePath combines daily habit tracking, guided meditation, emergency support tools, and educational resources into one seamless, user-friendly experience. The app features an inviting design with interactive menus such as Tracker, Meditate, SOS, and Health Education, all accessible from the home page. It also includes gamified elements like rewards and progress tracking in the user profile, encouraging continued engagement and motivation. PulsePath is not just a tool, it is envisioned as a daily wellness companion that supports users in building healthier routines, reducing stress, and staying informed.

To assess the usability and effectiveness of our prototype, we conducted a structured usability testing session on July 3rd, 2025. The testing took place in a home environment, allowing participants to engage with the system in a relaxed and familiar setting. Each session was conducted face to face, where we guided participants through the prototype using Figma on a laptop, and recorded the screen along with the user’s verbal feedback. This setup enabled us to observe natural behaviors and gain authentic insights into how users interact with the interface.

A total of three participants were involved in the testing, each representing a segment of our target user group. They were asked to complete three core tasks using the application. These tasks were designed to reflect typical user journeys and key functions within PulsePath. Before testing began, each user was given a brief and simple introduction to the purpose of the system without any instructions on how to operate it. This ensured that the evaluation measured the intuitiveness of the design and interaction flow.

During the test, users were informed that if they encountered any confusion or were unable to proceed, they could say “terminate”, at which point we would move to the next task. After completing all three tasks, participants were asked a series of open ended interview questions and ended by giving them a token of appreciation.

All participants provided positive feedback, describing the app as visually engaging, easy to navigate, and highly relevant to their personal needs. They found the layout intuitive and the content meaningful, especially appreciating the variety of wellness resources offered in one platform. The responses confirmed the strengths of our current prototype while also suggesting opportunities for improvement in future iterations.

This usability testing session gave us valuable insights into real user experiences, enabling us to validate our design assumptions and prepare for future refinements based on practical, user driven feedback.

Testing for User 1 was handled by Haritz Haykal.  
Testing for User 2 was handled by Muhammad Al-Hakimi.  
Testing for User 3 was handled by Ahmad Muzhaffar.

## 5. Observations – prepared by Haritz Haykal, Muhammad Al-Hakimi, Ahmad Muzhaffar

Upon finishing all of the three tasks, participants were given a set of open-ended interview questions. The following is the list of questions and the summarized responses provided by each users:

### Interview Questions:

**1. What do you think was easy when navigating this app?**

- User 1: "Everything is easy to navigate... direct."  
- User 2: "Everything is basically easy... I can track progress effortlessly."  
- User 3: "This is so easy to navigate..."

Ease of Use of Navigation and Usability: The app's user-friendly and intuitive navigation was praised by all participants.


**2. What was difficult about it?**

- User 1: "Not particularly anything"  
- User 2: "I don't think so."  
- User 3: "No, nothing."

Minor Difficulties: Only User 1 reported a small lag issue ("Sometimes it gets lags"), but considered to be manageable. There were no usability issues noted.


**3. Why or when would you use the system?**

- User 1: "I would use it always... it tracks everything I need."  
- User 2: "Perfect for busy people with mental health or routine issues."

## 6. Findings – prepared by Haritz Haykal, Muhammad Al-Hakimi, AHmad Muzhaffar

Upon completing all three tasks, users were asked a series of open-ended interview questions to share their thoughts and experiences using the prototype. These questions aimed to discover any difficulties they faced, what they liked, and suggestions for improvement. Based on their responses and our observations during the test, we identified a few findings that highlight small issues and areas where the app can be improved. The following are the findings along with simple recommendations for each.

### 1. Minor Lag During Use (User 1)

**Finding:** The user mentioned that the app “sometimes gets lags,” although it wasn’t a big issue.  
**Implication:** Minor lag may affect the smoothness of interaction and cause small frustration during use.  
**Recommendation:** Improve performance by optimizing transitions and screen loading speed.

### 2. Limited Engagement with SOS and Meditation Tools (User 2)

**Finding:** While users acknowledged the usefulness of the SOS and Meditation tools, their interaction with those features was brief or shallow.  
**Implication:** The lack of context or prompting may prevent users from fully exploring these essential support tools.  
**Recommendation:** Add micro-guidance (e.g., “Tap to connect with a counselor”) and friendly pop-ups explaining each tool's purpose during the first visit.

### 3. Confusion in Podcast Playback (User 3)

**Finding:** The user asked, “Can I hear it?” when trying the podcast feature, showing uncertainty about whether the audio was playing.  
**Implication:** Lack of visual or sound feedback may lead users to think the feature is not working.  
**Recommendation:** Add a progress bar, and a clear label like “Now Playing.”

## Summary
The usability testing of PulsePath showed consistent positive feedback across all three participants, highlighting the application's intuitive navigation, extensive feature set, and strong alignment with daily routines. Participants praised the app’s ease of use, acknowledged the navigation as "direct," and "effortless," with only minor technical lag issues noticed by one user, and resolved without affecting the overall usability. All users expressed high interest to integrate PulsePath into their daily lives, citing its relevance for tracking health metrics (e.g., sleep, calories), accessing mental health support (meditation guides, SOS chat/call with professionals), and engage with the educational contents (videos, quizzes, etc.).

The prototype appeared to be functionally complete, with no significant drawbacks identified. Users specifically praised its extensive tracking features, the diversity of health education types (such as summary of videos for short attention spans), and the quick action of the SOS option. User engagement is enhanced even more by the aesthetic appeal, such as calming colors and a clean interface. Furthermore, all participants commended the system as "perfect" or "covers everything," emphasising its utility as a wellness companion. While suggesting minor improvements for upcoming versions, such as lag optimisation and expanding SOS professional networks, these observations support the core foundation of PulsePath.
