## 1. Introduction

In an era where mental health and well-being are becoming increasingly important, our group developed PulsePath, a holistic wellness mobile application designed to empower users in managing their mental and physical health. PulsePath combines daily habit tracking, guided meditation, emergency support tools, and educational resources into one seamless, user-friendly experience. The app features an inviting design with interactive menus such as Tracker, Meditate, SOS, and Health Education, all accessible from the home page. It also includes gamified elements like rewards and progress tracking in the user profile, encouraging continued engagement and motivation. PulsePath is not just a tool, it is envisioned as a daily wellness companion that supports users in building healthier routines, reducing stress, and staying informed.

To assess the usability and effectiveness of our prototype, we conducted a structured usability testing session on July 3rd, 2025. The testing took place in a home environment, allowing participants to engage with the system in a relaxed and familiar setting. Each session was conducted face to face, where we guided participants through the prototype using Figma on a laptop, and recorded the screen along with the user’s verbal feedback. This setup enabled us to observe natural behaviors and gain authentic insights into how users interact with the interface.

A total of three participants were involved in the testing, each representing a segment of our target user group. They were asked to complete three core tasks using the application. These tasks were designed to reflect typical user journeys and key functions within PulsePath. Before testing began, each user was given a brief and simple introduction to the purpose of the system without any instructions on how to operate it. This ensured that the evaluation measured the intuitiveness of the design and interaction flow.

During the test, users were informed that if they encountered any confusion or were unable to proceed, they could say “terminate”, at which point we would move to the next task. After completing all three tasks, participants were asked a series of open ended interview questions and ended by giving them a token of appreciation.

All participants provided positive feedback, describing the app as visually engaging, easy to navigate, and highly relevant to their personal needs. They found the layout intuitive and the content meaningful, especially appreciating the variety of wellness resources offered in one platform. The responses confirmed the strengths of our current prototype while also suggesting opportunities for improvement in future iterations.

This usability testing session gave us valuable insights into real user experiences, enabling us to validate our design assumptions and prepare for future refinements based on practical, user driven feedback.

Testing for User 1 was handled by Haritz Haykal.  
Testing for User 2 was handled by Muhammad Al-Hakimi.  
Testing for User 3 was handled by Ahmad Muzhaffar.

## 3. Briefing Notes – prepared by Haritz Haykal, Muhammad Al-Hakimi Haikal, Ahmad Muzhaffar

> For this part we all gave the same briefing

> “Hello, we are from group Clicksquad, and we would like to test our prototype.  
> So, you will be recorded in this video and this video will be used for our group project.  
> Do you have a concern?  
>
> Hello and thank you for participating in this usability test.  
> Today, we will be testing a prototype of our application called PulsePath.  
> This application is designed to help users do automatic tracking for mental health support and interactive health education.  
> The main idea behind this application is to solve the common problems users face when trying to track the task, having busy schedules, etc.  
> You do not need any prior experience with this type of application to participate.  
> During the test, we will ask you to complete three simple tasks using our prototype.  
> Please remember, this is not a test of your abilities.  
> We are testing the design of our system.  
> Feel free to think out loud as you go through the tasks.  
> If at any point you are stuck and don't know how to proceed, just say ‘terminate’ and we'll move on to the next task.  
>
> That's all for the briefing.  
> Are you ready to begin?  
> Please proceed with the first task.”
