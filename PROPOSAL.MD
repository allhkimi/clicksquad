**TOPIC: GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING**

## Problem

In this day and age, good health and well-being has become one of the many problems that people struggle with and it is also 1 of 17 Sustainable Development Goals identified by the United Nations. People that struggle with mental health often have problems with accessibility and ease of use, especially people that struggle with anxiety, stress, or emotional fatigue. These users prefer systems that are simple, straightforward and easy to navigate. Currently, most platforms do the opposite of these things and as a result make the users feel even more stressed when attempting to seek help, making the platform less effective for their mental well-being.

Other than claustrophobic mental health websites, there is also poor tracking in Health & Fitness Apps as one of the problems. Health and fitness apps are designed to support users in tracking their physical activities and wellness routines, but many fail due to usability issues. These apps often require manual input which can become very annoying and time-consuming for many users. Additionally, unclear feedback or a lack of progress visualization makes it difficult for users to stay motivated. This makes many users feeling stressed out and will lead to the user giving up on the app which makes it difficult for users to keep up a healthy lifestyle.

Lastly, there is also a lack of health awareness tools for students. Many students struggle to maintain healthy habits during school due to a lack of engaging and accessible health awareness tools. While there is information on the Internet, it is often difficult to find solid and consistent information on certain health topics. This makes the students unsure of which method to apply on improving their health. Current platforms rarely use interactive features that appeal to younger users or support consistent engagement. Therefore, students could be missing out on basic aspects of health such as nutrition, sleep and hydration, all of which can improve their overall physical health and academics.

## Solution

As stated in the problem overview above, the current mental health platforms such as SAMHSA's Homelessness Resources site, are often information-heavy and quite visually overwhelming to some users, especially those struggling with anxiety, stress, or emotional fatigue that would have to encounter difficulty navigating through dense information and complicated UI designs. This contradicts with the good UI/UX practices, where simplicity and clarity are prioritized to reduce cognitive load. In UI/UX standards as well as in accordance with Nielsen's Heuristics, a good system should prioritize usability, feedback and flexibility. This was supported by Sweller’s (1998) Cognitive Load Theory, where unnecessary and excessive information in mental health platforms can impose extraneous cognitive load on users. When users with anxiety or stress are confronted with visually cluttered interfaces, their cognitive resources are consumed by navigating through the system rather than focusing on the content.

To solve these problems, we introduce **PulsePath**, a web-based application dedicated to simplifying and enhancing user experience for good health and well-being. The web application is meant to track and improve a user's physical and mental health by visualizing their progress and allowing them to learn ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The app will provide smart tracking and gamified mental health support, tailored to reduce anxiety, stress and cognitive overload.
