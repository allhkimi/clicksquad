We are <strong>ClickSquad</strong> — a group of passionate Computing students from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM JB), working together on an exciting Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project.

Our group name represents more than just a cool tagline — it’s the core of what we do. Every digital experience begins with a click, and behind that click lies careful design, thoughtful interaction, and user-centered thinking. That’s exactly what we aim to explore, evaluate, and improve through our work.

Whether we’re running usability tests, analyzing interfaces, or building prototypes, we work as a squad — united by our curiosity, creativity, and drive to build better interactions between humans and technology.
